Literally my bad selfbot

Create a folder named backups within the folder its located - make an file in the same folder
as the code named just ".env" and within it there should be "DISCORD_TOKEN=" on the first line
followed by your discord token

Also maybe add folders called "Terminal_ouptut" and "backup", they arent nessecary but yk i aint
competent so there might be bugs
