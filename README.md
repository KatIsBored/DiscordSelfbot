Literally my bad selfbot
Create a folder named backups within the folder its located - make an file in the same folder as the code named just ".env" and within it there should be "DISCORD_TOKEN=" on the first line followed by your discord token

Also maybe add folders called "Terminal_ouptut" and "backup", they arent nessecary but yk i aint competent so there might be bugs

Thanks to WfSecs for "letting" me sample some code
